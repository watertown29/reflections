When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If multiple people will be working on the same file. If you want to work on
    something at home. For security. In case your computer breaks.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to test something on your own first. It
    would take up compute power. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones, but on GitHub. They allow people to
    see who originally made the code. Clones are just copies
    and they can be just on your computer, or pulled from 
    GitHub. Branches are tools used to create a different
    workstream within the same project, using the same
    code base.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work offline! But you also want to be working with the lastest version of the project.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Email I guess. Also, just having to be all physically located together. This would allow people to easily collaborate when not together. And it is great to have a record of changes. It also allows someone to QC any changes to the master branch. The harder part is having to merge.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If your feature is not approved for the master yet. To test out something before commiting to the whole project.
